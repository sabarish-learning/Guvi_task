**What is docker file?**

`Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. This page describes the commands you can use in a `Dockerfile`

**List of docker file commands**

FROM - to specify the base image which we want use 

WORKDIR - to define the working directory for any commands that follow in the docker file.

RUN - to install a package or any application

COPY - to copy over files or directories from a specific location

ADD - same as COPY, but we can also use a URL instead of a local file /directory and we can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.

ENTRYPOINT - Command that will always be executed when the container starts. if not specified, the defaults is /bin/sh -c

CMD - to define a default command to run when your container starts

EXPOSE - to define which port through which to access your container application

LABEL - to add metadata to the image.

ARG - to define which we can store argument values

USR- to define which user we can use here is vagrant user. By default user is root

**Docker build**
